1. Read through filesystems documentation
    and figure out how to do other tasks with filesystems
2. Implement the filesystems module into our quiz
    At the end of the quiz a file should be created which has all the
    users answers and scores

ONLY IF YOU GOT/UNDERSTAND THE OTHER TWO
3. Create a way to uniquely create the quiz files to the user
    ie. If another person with the same name takes the quiz, it won't
    just add on to the already existing file.
    Also prevent users from being able to take the quiz twice

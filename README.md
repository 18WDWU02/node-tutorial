# Node JS

Visit the [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) website for all the documentation about Node JS.

## What is node JS
Node JS is a JavaScript Framework/Enviroment used to run JavaScript in a server rather then backend coding.
Usually backend languages like PHP would be used but with Node JS we can just use JavaScript.

Node JS by defauly is Asynchronous, which means that multiple things are happening at the same time.  

### Running a node File
To run a node file you need to create a js file in the directory.
In this project there are a few node files in there already. The first one you should look at is firstnode.js
To run this you need to open the terminal and move into the directory which the file is in and type out
```sh
$ node filename
```
In this example we will write
```sh
$ node firstnode
```
You dont need to include the .js at the end but if you would like to you can.
